# For chronic twitch chatters

Designed to allow you to be in multiple chats at once.

## How do I use it?

Place the names of the channels in the input field, separated by either a space or comma.

If the client manages to join the channel successfully, you'll see the name of it appear below the message box.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

Run the command to install the packages.

```
npm run dev
```

To start the development server.

### TODO
